# ConwaysGame
A recreation of Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
The game updates to the next state upon a mouse click. To change this to a timer, comment out line 112 (win.getMouse()) and uncomment line 111 (time.sleep(0.25)).
I did not create graphics.py. Its source is in its code.
